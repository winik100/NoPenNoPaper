= NoPenNoPaper (WIP)

A humble web-application to create and manage characters for the Pen&Paper system https://pegasus.de/cthulhu[Cthulhu].

== How to run
In any Command-Line Interface:
. Start the MySQL Docker container via ``docker compose up`` (requires Docker Compose to be installed)
. Create a `/tls` folder containing a https://letsencrypt.org/[TLS certificate] (filenames `cert.pem` and `key.pem`)
.. For dev/playing around: generate via `go run /<PATH>/go/src/crypto/tls/generate_cert.go --rsa-bits=2048 --host=localhost` in the newly created folder
. Run the application via the ``NoPenNoPaper`` executable or `go run ./cmd/web`
. Go to ``https://localhost:8080`` (or replace 'localhost' with the server's IP)

== TODO
    * frontend needs more functionality (editing, validation)
    * more testing
    * implement campaigns and campaign management
    * implement game material (maps/images) distribution for game masters
    * proper css (disclaimer: as of now, the style sheet is a slightly modified version of the one from https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/[Let's Go by Alex Edwards])
