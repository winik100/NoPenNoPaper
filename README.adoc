= NoPenNoPaper (WIP)

A humble web-application to create and manage characters for the Pen&Paper system https://pegasus.de/cthulhu[Cthulhu].

== How to run
. Start the MySQL Docker container via ``docker compose up`` (requires Docker Compose to be installed)
. Run the application via the ``NoPenNoPaper`` executable
.. Alternatively, run via ``go run ./cmd/web`` (requires Go to be installed)
. Go to ``https://localhost:8080`` (or replace 'localhost' with the server's IP to connect from within the same network)

== TODO
    * frontend needs more functionality (editing, validation)
    * more testing
    * implement campaigns and campaign management
    * implement game material (maps/images) distribution for game masters
    * proper skill validation (need to learn the system more first)
